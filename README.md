# TwitchChatApplication

This application is aimed primarily at novice streamers who do not have a second monitor to read the chat.
It can also help a popular streamers that make "irl" stream. For example, when several streamers from the one stream travel in a car, they can't easily read the chat from the stream, it requires a lot of battery power and cellular network data because the original twitch application requires downloading the stream.
This app is designed to reduce battery power and cellular data requirements.

Here you can see the twitch user authorization and automatic connection to the chat (the chat channel was hard-coded yet) =)

All layout of UIElements was coded programmatically
